    <h1>Privacy Policy - Codify Dev</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-04-22</p>

    <p>Welcome to Codify Dev! We are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy. This Privacy Policy aims to explain how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use the Codify Dev extension (hereinafter referred to as "this Extension").</p>

    <h2>1. Types of Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide core functionality, this Extension needs to access and process the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Figma Design Data:</strong> When you select design elements (nodes) on the Figma canvas within this Extension, we access the attribute information of these nodes (such as layer hierarchy, styles, layout, text content, etc.). This information is used solely to extract UI structure and styles to generate corresponding code for you.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Interaction Data:</strong> When you use the AI code generation feature, we send the extracted UI information and any additional context you may provide (e.g., your specific instructions or preferences) to third-party AI services (such as OpenAI or Deepseek API) to generate code suggestions. We do not send personally identifiable information directly to the AI service unless it is part of the design data itself (e.g., a layer name containing your name).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not actively collect personal identification information unrelated to the above functions, such as your name, email address, or Figma account credentials.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide Core Functionality:</strong> Analyze selected Figma design elements and display their information in the Extension interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Code:</strong> Send extracted UI information to AI services to generate front-end code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We share your data only under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharing with AI Service Providers:</strong> To enable the AI code generation feature, we send necessary UI information and context to third-party AI services (like OpenAI/Deepseek). These services have their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review. We only share data necessary to perform the function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Except as described above, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your data with any third party.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Location:</strong> Most processing occurs within the Extension or in your local browser environment. Figma design data and AI-generated code are typically processed temporarily for display in the interface, unless you take explicit action to save them (e.g., copy to clipboard). User configurations (if applicable) are usually stored in the browser's local storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We take reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please note that no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since this Extension primarily handles data from your Figma files and most processing is temporary or local, you can manage the relevant data directly through Figma or browser features. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can stop using this Extension at any time.</li>
        <li>You can clear your browser's local storage to delete any stored user configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions about your data or need further assistance, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through appropriate means (e.g., in-app notification or an update on the Chrome Web Store page). We encourage you to review this policy periodically for the latest information.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: 1343421593cys@gmail.com</p>
